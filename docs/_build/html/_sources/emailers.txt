Configuring Emailers 
====================

Station does not require the setup of any of Laravel's native functions or drivers, with one exception, ... email.

In order for Station to function properly it needs to be able to send emails for password reset requests. Therefore, please make sure that your app's ``config/mail.php`` has been configured and is running properly.
